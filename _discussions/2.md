Mozilla released a VR website builder app - [Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/).

I spent some time adding our NFTs to a room/space. You can modify scenes, add models, and add audio/video/images to your space. I'm going to look into feasibility for using Hubs as a display for the Foundation's NFTs! It might work best as an additional feature on the main website vs the actual website for now. TBD. Let me know what you think!

You can check it out below. ðŸ‘‡
